`*Did you know that The Moon’s surface is actually dark
Although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.​`


`*The Moon makes the Earth move as well as the tides
Everyone knows that the Moon is partly responsible for causing the tides of our oceans and seas on Earth, with the Sun also having an effect.
However, as the Moon orbits the Earth it also causes a tide of rock to rise and fall in the same way as it does with the water. The effect is not as dramatic as with the oceans, but nevertheless it is a measurable effect, with the solid surface of the Earth moving by several centimetres with each tide.`
 
`*The Moon has quakes too
They're not called earthquakes but moonquakes. They are caused by the gravitational influence of the Earth. Unlike quakes on Earth that last only a few minutes at most, moonquakes can last up to half an hour. They are much weaker than earthquakes though.`

*Now we will talk about the eclipse*

`**Did you know that The longest duration for a total solar eclipse possible is 7.5 minutes. During this eclipse the shadow of the Moon races across the Earth at 2410 mph in western Oregon down to 1502 mph near Chareston, SC. Partial solar eclipses can be seen up to 3,000 miles from the "track" of totality.`**

*Eclipse Fun Facts*

`The cycle of eclipses repeats every 18.6 years called the saros.
Lunar eclipses are visible over an entire hemisphere.
Lunar eclipses can occur up to 3 times a year.
A soar eclipse always occurs two weeks before or after a lunar eclipse.
Lunar eclipses can only occur during a full moon.`
